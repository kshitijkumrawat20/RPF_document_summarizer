It serves as a powerful framework for creating and managing the execution flow of complex agents and systems that require memory, iteration, and conditional logic.\\n\\n## 1. Definition, Purpose, and Relationship to LangChain\\n\\n### What is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph is a Python library that extends the capabilities of LangChain by structuring the execution flow as a **stateful, directed graph**. Instead of the linear or simple sequential chains common in basic LangChain applications, LangGraph allows developers to define complex, arbitrary execution paths.\\n\\n### Purpose\\nThe primary purpose of LangGraph is to enable the creation of **robust, cyclical, and iterative agents**. It moves beyond the simple input/output structure of standard LLM calls to build systems capable of:\\n1.  **State Management:** Maintaining and updating a shared state across multiple steps.\\n2.  **Conditional Routing:** Deciding the *next* step based on the output of the *current* step.\\n3.  **Iteration/Cycles:** Allowing the agent to loop back on itself until a desired condition is met (e.g., a search process refining its query, or a reasoning loop concluding).\\n\\n### Relationship to LangChain\\nLangGraph is built **on top of LangChain**. It does not replace LangChain but rather augments it.\\n*   **LangChain** provides the fundamental building blocks: LLMs, Prompts, Tools, Memory components, and basic pre-defined Chains (like `LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`).\\n*   **LangGraph** provides the *orchestration layer*. It takes these LangChain components (which become its \"nodes\") and defines *how* they interact, in what order, and under what conditions. Any LangChain object that can be called (like a tool or a runnable chain) can be used as a node in a LangGraph.\\n\\n## 2. Core Concepts\\n\\nLangGraph structures workflows around three central concepts: **Nodes**, **Edges**, and **Cycles**.\\n\\n### A. Nodes (The Computations)\\nA **Node** represents a single, atomic step or operation within the graph. This is where the actual computation happens.\\n*   **What they are:** A node is any callable object that accepts the current graph state as input and returns an updated state or a set of edges to follow.\\n*   **Typical Content:**\\n    *   **Functions:** Custom Python functions that encapsulate specific logic.\\n    *   **LLMs/Chains:** A LangChain `Runnable` (like an LLM call, a specific chain, or a tool executor).\\n    *   **Tools:** Executing a specific tool with the current state information.\\n\\n### B. Edges (The Flow Control)\\n**Edges** define the mandatory path between nodes. They dictate the transition from one step to the next.\\n*   **Conditional Edges:** The most powerful type. Instead of a fixed path, a conditional edge uses a *conditional function* that examines the output or the current state and returns a specific string corresponding to the next node to execute. This enables dynamic routing based on runtime results.\\n    *   *Example:* If the LLM output is \"Finish\", the edge routes to the \"END\" node. If the output is \"Search\", it routes to the \"Search\\\\_Tool\" node.\\n*   **Normal Edges:** A fixed path from one node to the next, used for linear sequences.\\n\\n### C. Cycles (Iteration and Statefulness)\\n**Cycles** are the defining feature that distinguishes LangGraph from simple Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). A cycle occurs when an edge points back to a previously visited node, creating a loop.\\n*   **How it works:** The graph execution engine automatically handles the loop. As long as the conditional edges route the execution back into the cycle, the graph will continue to run, updating the **Shared State** with the output of each node execution.\\n*   **Key Requirement:** To prevent infinite loops, the logic within the cycle (usually the conditional edge\\'s routing function) *must* eventually transition to a node outside the cycle or to the designated \"END\" node.\\n\\n### The Shared State\\nThe entire graph operates on a mutable **Shared State**. This state is passed from node to node.\\n*   It is typically a dictionary or Pydantic model.\\n*   Every node\\'s function modifies this state (e.g., adding a tool output, updating a conversation history, or recording a reasoning step).\\n*   This state persistence is what enables complex memory and multi-step reasoning.\\n\\n## 3. Practical Use Cases and Examples\\n\\nLangGraph excels in scenarios where an agent needs to think, act, observe, and reflect iteratively.\\n\\n### A. Stateful Agents (Tool Use)\\nThis is the most common use case. The graph models the \"ReAct\" loop:\\n1.  **Node 1 (Thought/Action Selection):** LLM decides what to do (e.g., call a tool or answer).\\n2.  **Conditional Edge:** Checks the LLM output. If it\\'s a tool call, route to the Tool Executor. If it\\'s the final answer, route to END.\\n3.  **Node 2 (Tool Execution):** Executes the requested tool, getting an observation.\\n4.  **Edge:** Routes back to Node 1, injecting the observation into the state so the LLM can incorporate the new data into its next thought process.\\n*   **Benefit:** LangGraph naturally models this iterative loop where the agent must observe the result of an action before deciding the next step.\\n\\n### B. Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (Planning)\\nFor tasks requiring complex planning (like generating code or long-form analysis), LangGraph can enforce structured reasoning steps:\\n1.  **Node: Planning:** LLM generates a high-level plan.\\n2.  **Node: Step 1 Execution:** Executes the first step of the plan.\\n3.  **Node: Evaluation/Refinement:** A separate LLM node evaluates the output of Step 1 against the original plan and suggests revisions.\\n4.  **Conditional Edge:** Routes to \"Step 2 Execution\" if the plan is on track, or back to \"Planning\" if major revisions are needed (a cycle for plan iteration).\\n\\n### C. Advanced Routing and Tool Selection\\nWhen an agent has many specialized tools, LangGraph can define a robust routing layer:\\n1.  **Node: Input Router:** An LLM or simple function determines *which* major task category the request belongs to (e.g., \"Database Query,\" \"File System Access,\" \"General Chat\").\\n2.  **Conditional Edge:** Routes to the appropriate subgraph or tool executor dedicated to that task. This prevents one massive, complex chain from handling all logic, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and often faster workflows.\\n\\n---\\n**Conclusion:** LangGraph transforms the process of building intelligent systems from stitching together sequential components into **designing dynamic computational graphs**. By explicitly modeling state, iteration, and conditional routing, it provides the necessary structure to move beyond simple prompt chains and build truly autonomous, state-aware agents.', name='task', id='536dd3e3-b2e9-4304-831d-1227422a7a64', tool_call_id='eee4ba73-bc6c-4f20-94bd-a4b02ce27509'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'function_call': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.\", \"status\": \"completed\"}, {\"status\": \"completed\", \"content\": \"Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).\"}, {\"content\": \"Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.\", \"status\": \"completed\"}, {\"status\": \"completed\", \"content\": \"Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.\"}]}'}}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b1e47-d25e-7ed3-9be8-7d1de272e69d-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'write_todos', 'args': {'todos': [{'content': 'Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'status': 'completed', 'content': 'Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'status': 'completed', 'content': 'Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.'}]}, 'id': '28422b09-ead5-43de-8b2f-5453f87f4b5c', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6917, 'output_tokens': 130, 'total_tokens': 7047, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), ToolMessage(content=\"Updated todo list to [{'content': 'Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.', 'status': 'completed'}]\", name='write_todos', id='ad34d112-ecd7-4955-b815-313435a3be35', tool_call_id='28422b09-ead5-43de-8b2f-5453f87f4b5c'), AIMessage(content=\"LangGraph is an extension library for **LangChain** that introduces a **graph-based execution model** for building complex, stateful, and multi-step AI applications, particularly advanced agents.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of what it is, what it does, and why it's important:\\n\\n### 1.
