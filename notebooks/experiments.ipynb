It serves as a powerful framework for creating and managing the execution flow of complex agents and systems that require memory, iteration, and conditional logic.\\n\\n## 1. Definition, Purpose, and Relationship to LangChain\\n\\n### What is LangGraph?\\nLangGraph is a Python library that extends the capabilities of LangChain by structuring the execution flow as a **stateful, directed graph**. Instead of the linear or simple sequential chains common in basic LangChain applications, LangGraph allows developers to define complex, arbitrary execution paths.\\n\\n### Purpose\\nThe primary purpose of LangGraph is to enable the creation of **robust, cyclical, and iterative agents**. It moves beyond the simple input/output structure of standard LLM calls to build systems capable of:\\n1.  **State Management:** Maintaining and updating a shared state across multiple steps.\\n2.  **Conditional Routing:** Deciding the *next* step based on the output of the *current* step.\\n3.  **Iteration/Cycles:** Allowing the agent to loop back on itself until a desired condition is met (e.g., a search process refining its query, or a reasoning loop concluding).\\n\\n### Relationship to LangChain\\nLangGraph is built **on top of LangChain**. It does not replace LangChain but rather augments it.\\n*   **LangChain** provides the fundamental building blocks: LLMs, Prompts, Tools, Memory components, and basic pre-defined Chains (like `LLMChain`, `SequentialChain`).\\n*   **LangGraph** provides the *orchestration layer*. It takes these LangChain components (which become its \"nodes\") and defines *how* they interact, in what order, and under what conditions. Any LangChain object that can be called (like a tool or a runnable chain) can be used as a node in a LangGraph.\\n\\n## 2. Core Concepts\\n\\nLangGraph structures workflows around three central concepts: **Nodes**, **Edges**, and **Cycles**.\\n\\n### A. Nodes (The Computations)\\nA **Node** represents a single, atomic step or operation within the graph. This is where the actual computation happens.\\n*   **What they are:** A node is any callable object that accepts the current graph state as input and returns an updated state or a set of edges to follow.\\n*   **Typical Content:**\\n    *   **Functions:** Custom Python functions that encapsulate specific logic.\\n    *   **LLMs/Chains:** A LangChain `Runnable` (like an LLM call, a specific chain, or a tool executor).\\n    *   **Tools:** Executing a specific tool with the current state information.\\n\\n### B. Edges (The Flow Control)\\n**Edges** define the mandatory path between nodes. They dictate the transition from one step to the next.\\n*   **Conditional Edges:** The most powerful type. Instead of a fixed path, a conditional edge uses a *conditional function* that examines the output or the current state and returns a specific string corresponding to the next node to execute. This enables dynamic routing based on runtime results.\\n    *   *Example:* If the LLM output is \"Finish\", the edge routes to the \"END\" node. If the output is \"Search\", it routes to the \"Search\\\\_Tool\" node.\\n*   **Normal Edges:** A fixed path from one node to the next, used for linear sequences.\\n\\n### C. Cycles (Iteration and Statefulness)\\n**Cycles** are the defining feature that distinguishes LangGraph from simple Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). A cycle occurs when an edge points back to a previously visited node, creating a loop.\\n*   **How it works:** The graph execution engine automatically handles the loop. As long as the conditional edges route the execution back into the cycle, the graph will continue to run, updating the **Shared State** with the output of each node execution.\\n*   **Key Requirement:** To prevent infinite loops, the logic within the cycle (usually the conditional edge\\'s routing function) *must* eventually transition to a node outside the cycle or to the designated \"END\" node.\\n\\n### The Shared State\\nThe entire graph operates on a mutable **Shared State**. This state is passed from node to node.\\n*   It is typically a dictionary or Pydantic model.\\n*   Every node\\'s function modifies this state (e.g., adding a tool output, updating a conversation history, or recording a reasoning step).\\n*   This state persistence is what enables complex memory and multi-step reasoning.\\n\\n## 3. Practical Use Cases and Examples\\n\\nLangGraph excels in scenarios where an agent needs to think, act, observe, and reflect iteratively.\\n\\n### A. Stateful Agents (Tool Use)\\nThis is the most common use case. The graph models the \"ReAct\" loop:\\n1.  **Node 1 (Thought/Action Selection):** LLM decides what to do (e.g., call a tool or answer).\\n2.  **Conditional Edge:** Checks the LLM output. If it\\'s a tool call, route to the Tool Executor. If it\\'s the final answer, route to END.\\n3.  **Node 2 (Tool Execution):** Executes the requested tool, getting an observation.\\n4.  **Edge:** Routes back to Node 1, injecting the observation into the state so the LLM can incorporate the new data into its next thought process.\\n*   **Benefit:** LangGraph naturally models this iterative loop where the agent must observe the result of an action before deciding the next step.\\n\\n### B. Complex Multi-Step Reasoning (Planning)\\nFor tasks requiring complex planning (like generating code or long-form analysis), LangGraph can enforce structured reasoning steps:\\n1.  **Node: Planning:** LLM generates a high-level plan.\\n2.  **Node: Step 1 Execution:** Executes the first step of the plan.\\n3.  **Node: Evaluation/Refinement:** A separate LLM node evaluates the output of Step 1 against the original plan and suggests revisions.\\n4.  **Conditional Edge:** Routes to \"Step 2 Execution\" if the plan is on track, or back to \"Planning\" if major revisions are needed (a cycle for plan iteration).\\n\\n### C. Advanced Routing and Tool Selection\\nWhen an agent has many specialized tools, LangGraph can define a robust routing layer:\\n1.  **Node: Input Router:** An LLM or simple function determines *which* major task category the request belongs to (e.g., \"Database Query,\" \"File System Access,\" \"General Chat\").\\n2.  **Conditional Edge:** Routes to the appropriate subgraph or tool executor dedicated to that task. This prevents one massive, complex chain from handling all logic, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and often faster workflows.\\n\\n---\\n**Conclusion:** LangGraph transforms the process of building intelligent systems from stitching together sequential components into **designing dynamic computational graphs**. By explicitly modeling state, iteration, and conditional routing, it provides the necessary structure to move beyond simple prompt chains and build truly autonomous, state-aware agents.', name='task', id='536dd3e3-b2e9-4304-831d-1227422a7a64', tool_call_id='eee4ba73-bc6c-4f20-94bd-a4b02ce27509'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'function_call': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.\", \"status\": \"completed\"}, {\"status\": \"completed\", \"content\": \"Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).\"}, {\"content\": \"Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.\", \"status\": \"completed\"}, {\"status\": \"completed\", \"content\": \"Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.\"}]}'}}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b1e47-d25e-7ed3-9be8-7d1de272e69d-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'write_todos', 'args': {'todos': [{'content': 'Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'status': 'completed', 'content': 'Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'status': 'completed', 'content': 'Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.'}]}, 'id': '28422b09-ead5-43de-8b2f-5453f87f4b5c', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6917, 'output_tokens': 130, 'total_tokens': 7047, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), ToolMessage(content=\"Updated todo list to [{'content': 'Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.', 'status': 'completed'}]\", name='write_todos', id='ad34d112-ecd7-4955-b815-313435a3be35', tool_call_id='28422b09-ead5-43de-8b2f-5453f87f4b5c'), AIMessage(content=\"LangGraph is an extension library for **LangChain** that introduces a **graph-based execution model** for building complex, stateful, and multi-step AI applications, particularly advanced agents.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of what it is, what it does, and why it's important:\\n\\n### 1. Core Concept: Graph-Based Execution\\nInstead of building applications as a simple sequence of steps (linear chains), LangGraph allows you to define your workflow as a **Directed Graph**. This enables:\\n*   **Statefulness:** The graph maintains a **Shared State** (like memory or context) that is updated and passed between steps, allowing the agent to remember past actions and observations.\\n*   **Cycles:** You can create loops where the workflow can run iteratively (e.g., an agent taking an action, observing the result, and then deciding on the next action) until a specific termination condition is met.\\n*   **Conditional Routing:** The execution path is not fixed. Logic determines the **next node** to execute based on the output of the current node (e.g., if an LLM output suggests it needs to call a tool, the graph routes to the Tool Execution node; if it suggests the answer is final, it routes to the END node).\\n\\n### 2. Key Components\\n\\n| Component | Description | Role in the Workflow |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| **Nodes** | The fundamental units of computation. | These are the steps where work happens, often comprising a LangChain component like an LLM call, a Tool execution, or a custom function. |\\n| **Edges** | Define the transition logic between nodes. | They specify *which* node runs next. **Conditional Edges** are key, as they inspect the current state to decide the next step dynamically. |\\n| **State** | The shared memory object passed through the graph. | Crucial for maintaining context, tool outputs, conversation history, and any artifacts generated during the multi-step process. |\\n\\n### 3. Relationship to LangChain\\nLangGraph is an **orchestration layer built on top of LangChain**.\\n*   **LangChain** provides the building blocks (LLMs, Tools, Chains).\\n*   **LangGraph** defines the structure, memory, and flow control, enabling these LangChain components to work together in complex, iterative loops that are necessary for advanced agents.\\n\\n### 4. Common Use Cases\\nLangGraph is ideal for any application requiring sophisticated, non-linear behavior:\\n1.  **Stateful Agents:** Implementing the classic **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) pattern, where an agent must observe the result of a tool call before deciding its next thought.\\n2.  **Complex Planning:** Creating systems that generate a plan, execute steps, evaluate the results, and iterate on the plan if necessary.\\n3.  **Advanced Routing:** Directing user requests to different sub-graphs or specialized chains based on intent analysis.\\n\\nIn essence, LangGraph gives developers the mathematical rigor of **graph theory** to design, debug, and deploy robust, iterative agents that can handle real-world complexity.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b1e47-d9e4-7021-a7d6-6d5aa7995866-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7177, 'output_tokens': 656, 'total_tokens': 7833, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})], 'files': {}, 'todos': [{'content': 'Use internet_search to find a definition and overview of LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find key features and concepts of LangGraph (e.g., graphs, nodes, edges, cycles).', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Use internet_search to find examples or common use cases for LangGraph.', 'status': 'completed'}, {'content': 'Synthesize all gathered information into a clear, expert explanation of what LangGraph is.', 'status': 'completed'}]}\n"

When sunlight enters the atmosphere, these molecules scatter the shorter blue wavelengths more efficiently than the longer red wavelengths (because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, $ \\\\lambda^{-4} $).\\n\\n3. **Why Blue, Not Violet?**: While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the sun emits less violet light. The combination of these factors makes the sky appear blue to us.\\n\\n4. **Day vs. Sunset**: During sunrise or sunset, sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering out the blue light and leaving the longer red/orange wavelengths to dominate—creating vibrant red skies.\\n\\nIn short: **Blue light scatters more in the atmosphere, and our eyes perceive it as the dominant color.** 🌤️\""
